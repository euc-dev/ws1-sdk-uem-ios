# Workspace ONE Software Development Kit Swift Package

This repository contains the documentation for the Workspace ONE software development kit (SDK) for iOS.

This repo is structured to feed into the developer.omnissa.com Developer Portal via the [](https://github.com/euc-dev/euc-dev.github.io) repo using MkDocs published by GitHub Pages. All documentation should be created in MarkDown format with the capabilities of MkDocs and the Material theme in mind.Only pages within the `/docs` folder should be modified within this repo.

This folder will be integrated into the [Omnissa Developer Portal repo](https://github.com/euc-dev/euc-dev.github.io) using GitHub Submodules. These pages will then be integrated into the Omnissa Developer Portal using a GitHub Action to build the GitHub Pages site.

The Workspace ONE SDK (formerly known as AirWatch SDK) code library for Apple iOS devices can be used to enable additional app config and security capabilities that may not yet be available natively as part of the AppConfig Community. Certain use cases such as granular analytics can be provided through a deeper integration with the SDK. The Workspace ONE SDK for iOS is also a good choice in deployment scenarios where a MDM profile installation on the device is not possible.

## Application Integration

To integrate the SDK into your app, proceed as follows.

1. Open your app project in Xcode.

2. Navigate to File, Swift Packages, Add Package Dependency...

    This opens the Choose Package Repository screen.

3. Enter the address of this repository `https://github.com/euc-oss/iOS-WorkspaceONE-SDK` and click Next.

    This opens the Choose Package Options screen.

4. Select the rule Branch, leave the default value for branch name, and click Next.

    Xcode will resolve the package dependency, which might take some time.

    When resolution finishes, an Add Package screen opens.

5. Select to add the AWSDK package product to your app target and click Finish.

The SDK has now been added to your application project. You can start the integration work. See the developer documentation.

## Other Integration

The SDK can also be integrated into products other than applications, such as frameworks and libraries. Add code like the following to your `Package.swift` file.

```swift
// swift-tools-version:5.9
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "YOUR_PROJECT_NAME",
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/euc-oss/iOS-WorkspaceONE-SDK.git", from: "24.6.0"),
    ]
)
```

Build your product in the usual way, for example by running the `swift` `build` command.
